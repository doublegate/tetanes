Yun
By The Mojon Twins

The main goal is helping yun capturing every single being to fill the pantry of
her restaurant. The Big Marsh near Lake Potoña (province of Badajoz), formed by
three areas (the marsh wood, the marsh abandoned factory and the mash desert) is
full of walking flesh Yun must capture.

To capture her enemies, Yun must stun them by means of hitting them with a
bubble. Once they are stunned, they can be captured just touching them.

Yun’s bubbles are quite resistant. You can hump on them and let them carry you
upwards, which is sometimes the only way to progress in the level.

Besides, there’s some points where Yun might need a key to keep going.
