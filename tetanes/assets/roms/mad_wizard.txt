Mad Wizard
By Sly Dog Studios

Take an adventure in the world of Candelabra!

The evil summoner Amondus from The Order of the Talon has taken over Prim,
Hekl's once happy homeland. And nothing drives a wizard more crazy than having
their territory trampled on!

Can you help Hekl defeat the enemies that Amondus has populated throughout the
landscape? To do so, you will need to master the art of levitation, find magic
spells that will assist you in reaching new areas, and upgrade your weapons. All
of these will be necessary in order to give Hekl the power he needs to restore
peace to Prim. Do you have what it takes? If you dare, venture into this, the
first installment of the Candelabra series!
