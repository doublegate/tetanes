Super Painter
By RetroSouls & Kulor

Trapped in a colorless world, armed with a paintbrush - there’s only one thing
to do! As Super Painter, you’ll have to fill in all the missing color from the
walls and ledges of 25 charming stages. Watch out for enemies and pits to the
bottom, and don’t box yourself in - when you’re done painting, you’ll have to
race to the magic door to the next level. It’s platform puzzling at its
finest!
